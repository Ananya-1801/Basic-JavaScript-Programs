# Basic JavaScript Programs

A small collection of beginner-level JavaScript programs written in HTML files. These scripts are interactive but do not use any styling or external libraries — just pure JavaScript and HTML.

### Table of Contents:
- **basic calculator.html** – Adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides two numbers.
- **bill calculating.html** - Calculates the discount on selected items over a given price range
- **calculator using onchange.html** - Performs all arithmetic operations over entered numbers interactively using events.
- **login in website.html** – A simple mock login system with user input fields.
- **multiplicationtable.html** – Displays the multiplication table for a given number upto given limit.
- **voting eligibility.html** – Checks voting eligibility based on age input.
  

### Purpose
This repository is part of my learning journey. It demonstrates basic logic, input/output, and DOM manipulation using JavaScript within HTML pages.

### How to Run
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open any `.html` file in a web browser.
3. Interact directly through the page interface.

> Note: No styling (CSS) or frameworks are used — the codes are intentionally kept minimal for maximum clarity.
